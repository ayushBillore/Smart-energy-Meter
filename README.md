# Smart Energy Meter: IoT-Based Power Monitoring System

## Description
The Smart Energy Meter is an IoT-based system designed to monitor and analyze electricity consumption in real-time. This project helps users track power usage, detect voltage fluctuations, and optimize energy consumption efficiently. By integrating smart sensors, cloud connectivity, and automation, it provides a reliable and cost-effective solution for energy management.

## Key Features
- **Real-Time Power Monitoring**: Continuously measures voltage, current, and power consumption.
- **IoT Integration**: Sends data to cloud platforms like Firebase, ThingSpeak, or MQTT for remote access.
- **Over/Under Voltage Detection**: Alerts users in case of abnormal voltage conditions to prevent damage.
- **Automated Billing System**: Calculates energy costs based on usage.
- **Mobile/Web Dashboard**: Provides a user-friendly interface for monitoring electricity consumption.
- **Energy Efficiency Insights**: Analyzes data trends to optimize energy usage and reduce wastage.

## How It Works
1. **Sensors (Voltage & Current)**: Measure power consumption in real-time.
2. **Microcontroller (ESP32/Arduino)**: Processes data and sends it to the cloud.
3. **Cloud & Mobile App**: Displays energy usage, cost estimation, and alerts.
4. **Smart Notifications**: Sends alerts for unusual consumption or voltage fluctuations.

This Smart Energy Meter helps users efficiently manage electricity usage, reduce energy waste, and lower electricity bills, making it an essential tool for smart homes and industries.
