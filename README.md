# Smart Energy Meter: IoT-Based Power Monitoring System

## Description
The Smart Energy Meter is an IoT-based system designed to monitor and analyze electricity consumption in real-time. This project helps users track power usage, detect voltage fluctuations, and optimize energy consumption efficiently. By integrating smart sensors, cloud connectivity, and automation, it provides a reliable and cost-effective solution for energy management.

## Key Features
- **Real-Time Power Monitoring**: Continuously measures voltage, current, and power consumption.
- **IoT Integration**: Sends data to cloud platforms like Firebase, ThingSpeak, or MQTT for remote access.
- **Over/Under Voltage Detection**: Alerts users in case of abnormal voltage conditions to prevent damage.
- **Automated Billing System**: Calculates energy costs based on usage.
- **Mobile/Web Dashboard**: Provides a user-friendly interface for monitoring electricity consumption.
- **Energy Efficiency Insights**: Analyzes data trends to optimize energy usage and reduce wastage.

## How It Works
1. **Sensors (Voltage & Current)**: Measure power consumption in real-time.
